Note the current HITL server implementation only handles one client at a time, so the expected behavior is that it becomes "unavailable" once it has a connected client.

For example, `--max-look-up-angle 0 --min-look-down-angle -45` to let the humanoid look down -45 degrees. You should also generally use `hide_humanoid_in_gui=True` with `first_person_mode`, because it doesn't make sense to visualize the humanoid with this camera.
